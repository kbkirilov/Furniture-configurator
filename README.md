## 💡 Description
The Furniture Configurator is a simple SAP application that allows users to interact with a virtual 3D model. The model can be viewed from different angles, panned, rotated, zoomed in, and zoomed out. Users can also change the chair's materials to a pre-set collection available in the application. I built it because I have always been fascinated by these kinds of projects, and now I know how to approach one like this.

## 🚀 Set and Startup project
1. Clone the repo to a directory of choice
2. Open the project with your desired IDE
3. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed: 
- [ ] Node.js

## 🎞️ Project video
If you don't want to do the above, here is a brief video of how the application is running.
